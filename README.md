# Training Bert Model 
# BERT Introduction:
BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a large language model (LLM) that was developed by Google AI. It is a type of neural network that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code
## PROJECT 

Trained a Bert Sequence Classification Model for Emotion Classification. also developed a virtual assistant and solved a problem in the existing Virtual Assistsant
 
 ##  AI Multi-Modal Emotion Analysis VoiceBot for both Text and Audio Input for Personalized and Inclusive Conversations using BERT LLM model

This project introduces an VoiceBot skill aimed at providing psychological advice. Explore how technology can contribute to mental well-being and consider contributing to make it even more impactful.
